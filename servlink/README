Servlink protocol documentation.
$Id$
--------------

After negotiating an incoming/outgoing server connection, the ircd will
fork, then execve servlink, with fd 0 as one end of a control pipe and
fd 1 as one end of a data pipe. fd 2 will be the socket connected to
the remote server.

The data pipe is used by the ircd to send/receive normal, decrypted,
uncompressed IRC commands to/from the remote server.  The socket is used to
send the (processed) data to the remote server, and receive the data from
the remote server.

The control pipe is used to activate encryption/compression and to set the
encryption key/algorithm to be used.

Format of control messages:

<u8 command><optional data>

data format:
<u16 len><data>

Commands:
