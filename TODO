- dynamically extensible parser for modules

- modularize channel, network code etc (not just commands)
  we can use override_function() or similar for this
  => means prepared, now just make use of them

- username/passwords (iauth ?)

- make the reserved FD limit run-time tunable, esp from comm_open()
  This involves making fd_table[] a dynamically growing/(don't bother with
  shrinking) list.. have the max fd list configurable in the conf file..
  => partially done, just turn HARD_FDLIMIT into a variable

- Add the IRCnet(?) split logic for nick collisions - on a nick collision,
  change to "%d-%s", random, nick
  => this is rather equal to their /nick 0, ie set nick to user's UID

Little things to be done given enough time and initiative -Hwy

.  <Riedel> walter : have you implemented the motd= thing in the auth block ?
.  A FAQ
.  More translations!


-- Rodder's list
.  Add scalable database-based authentication.  Probably part of Iauth.
   Also add support for server-side notify with the list stored in the
   auth database.  This would make ircd an awesome instant messaging
   back-end.
   => currently possible to do as a module


-- Diane's list
* add logging to ircd.log of possible channel floods
* add code to log a minute worth of flooding if the ircd gets n possible
  flood messages on a channel in t seconds.. This log would be available
  to hand to authorities if requested.


-- Josh's list
* Find out the status of the build with IRIX64/MIPSpro.
* TENDRA IS BROKEN! (Not quite our fault)
* Fix lack of error message for oper initiating /connect that fails because
it's a leaf.


-- knight's list
* Add Czechoslovakian support.
* Database Authentication (IAUTH).
* VMS, NetBSD, Mac OS X (testing and porting).
* AMD64, Sparc(64) testing and development.
* Re-work nickname collision code to change
  nicknames on collide rather than issue a
  server kill.


-- adx's list
* modularize parser, channel modes, member flags and more
* split libio (engines, logging etc) from irc related sources?
* implement ND/CD split logic
* implement /nick 0 and uid addressing
* more I/O backends (ports)
* get rid of conf attaching as much as possible


-- metalrock's list
* Fix that missing server connection timed out notice.
