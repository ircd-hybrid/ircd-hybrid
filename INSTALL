   | Reading INSTALL is now a must, as the old DPATH is now specified when  |

   | - You now need to ./configure --prefix="/path/to/install/it" as a      |
   |   minimum. Try ./configure --help or read this file for more info on   |
   |   the possible options you can pass to configure.                      |

   | - Important: The old config format WILL NOT WORK. Please see point 7!  |

   ***** EFNET NOTE *****
   You should run ./configure with the option '--enable-efnet' to tweak
   some options to be EFNet based. You must also use the example.efnet.conf
   instead of example.conf.

                                  HOW TO BUILD

   As of hybrid-4, the distribution uses GNU autoconf instead of the old
   Config script. You must run ./configure before you can (sanely) build
   ircd-hybrid.
   
   1.  Read the NEWS file to find out about the exciting new features in
       this version. Other good reads are BUGS, etc/example.conf, and
       README.

   2.  Run the configure script. It will create config.h and the
       Makefiles to match your system. In hybrid-7, the paths are now handled
       with the --prefix option to configure.
       /usr/local/ircd is the default if no prefix is specified.

       ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/ircd

       The script will determine whichever of the following is best for 
       your system, but you may (unsupported) force their usage with 
       undefined results:

          * --enable-kqueue - Use the superior kqueue(2) system call as
            opposed to the default poll(2). This is currently only available
            on FreeBSD 4.1 or higher.

          * --enable-devpoll - Enable the superior /dev/poll support on
            Solaris. Linux /dev/poll is broken and will not work with this
            option.

          * --enable-epoll - Enables epoll(4) Signal I/O system. This is
            currently only available on 2.5.44 Linux kernel versions or
            later.

          * --enable-rtsigio - Enable the superior Linux RealTime Signal I/O
            system. This is currently only available on 2.4 Linux kernel
            versions or later.

          * --enable-poll - Use POSIX poll(2).

          * --enable-select - Use POSIX select(2).

          Incidentally, the order of listing above is the order of auto-
          detection in configure. So if you do have kqueue but wish to
          enable select(2) instead (bad idea), you must use --enable-select.

          * --enable-openssl - Enable the openssl dependent crypto functions.
            This will allow CHALLENGE to work and encrypted links. On systems
            where the configure script can automatically detect OpenSSL, this
            option is not necessary. If configure cannot find OpenSSL, you
            must specify a path with this option
            (--enable-openssl=/path/to/openssl)


       These are optional or have default values that may be overridden:
   
          * --enable-assert - Enable use of numerous debugging checks. This
            should not be used on any production servers for maximum speed
            so as to prevent cores from things that shouldn't normally happen.

          * --enable-halfops - Enable halfops (%, mode +h) usage. Halfops
            are similar to plain ops, but can't kick/deop plain ops. Halfops
            may or may not kick/deop other halfops depending on if (+p) is
            set. Halfops may not set (+/-p).

          * --enable-small-net - Tunes the server for smaller networks by
            reducing the startup memory footprint. This should really only be
            used for *small* networks, as this tends to be a performance hit
            on larger networks.

          * --enable-syslog=kill/squit/connect/users/oper, separated by
            spaces, in quotes - Enables syslog logging, with events you specify
            (none is okay too, and logs the most essential messages only.)

          * --enable-syslog-facility=FACILITY - Check with your sysadmin to see
            what this should be; by default it is LOG_LOCAL4. If you get it wrong
            initially, no problem; just edit the value in include/setup.h.

          * --with-nicklen,
            --with-topiclen - Respectively, sets the maximum NICK length and
            maximum TOPIC length. Note that this must be consistent across your
            entire network. Defaults are 9 and 120, respectively.

          * --disable-zlib - Build the ircd without ziplinks support.


   3.  Run 'make'; this should build the ircd.

   4.  Run 'make install'; this will install the server, modules, and tools
       in the path with the prefix specified when configure was ran.

   5.  If you wish to install the contrib modules, run 'make install' in the
       contrib/ folder to compile and install the modules and help pages.

   6.  If you wish to enable the user log, oper log, and failed oper log,
       kill log, kline log and the gline log issue these commands at the
       shell prompt (in the prefix directory).

       $ touch logs/userlog
       $ touch logs/operlog
       $ touch logs/foperlog
       $ touch logs/kill
       $ touch logs/kline
       $ touch logs/gline

       Note: If you use different names in ircd.conf, you must 'touch'
             their specific names.

   7.  If you are upgrading from Hybrid 5 or Hybrid 6, the config files
       have changed drastically.

       By default, the kline file is named kline.conf, the dline file is 
       named dline.conf, and the xline file is called xline.conf.

       The nick resv file is named nresv.conf, channel resv file is named
       cresv.conf.

       The oper motd file is named opers.motd.

                                HOW TO GET HELP

   - Send Check or Money Order to... just kidding! You're on your own for
     support. Try asking other ircd-hybrid admins on EFnet if you can't 
     fix it yourself. If you do fix anything, however, please send context
     or unified diffs to bugs@ircd-hybrid.org so the fixes can be 
     incorporated into the next release of ircd-hybrid. If hybrid crashes
     on you, PLEASE contact bugs@ircd-hybrid.org ASAP with a backtrace of
     the core. The Hybrid team can't fix bugs if no one tells us about them!

   - https://lists.ircd-hybrid.org/mailman/listinfo/hybrid
     Here you can subscribe to a mailing list for general discussion of Hybrid.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                                     NOTES

   The best way to get a backtrace of the core is to follow this sequence of
   instructions:

   1.  Change to the directory containing the core file

   2.  Run gdb on the binary and the core file. With an unmodified ircd-hybrid
       installation, an example command line is below (in the /usr/local/ircd
       directory)

       $ gdb bin/ircd ircd.core


   3.  At the "(gdb)" prompt, enter the command "bt full"

   4.  Save the output of the backtrace command and send it to
       bugs@ircd-hybrid.org.

   5.  Be sure to save the ircd binary, the modules, and the core file in a
       safe place in case the developers need to look deeper than a backtrace
       provides.
