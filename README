******************************* IMPORTANT *************************************

  ************ Note for those who don't bother reading docs ***************
  * - Reading INSTALL is now a must, as the old DPATH is now specified    *
  *   when configure is run.                                              *
  *   You now need to ./configure --prefix="/path/to/install/it"          *
  * - The old config format WILL NOT WORK. Please see doc/reference.conf !*
  * - The old kline, dline, xline format WILL NOT WORK.                   *
  *************************************************************************

  ALSO, IF YOU ARE UPGRADING YOUR CURRENT SOURCE TREE, AND YOU TRY TO BUILD
  IN IT WITHOUT PERFORMING AT LEAST 'make clean', THINGS _WILL_ BREAK. IT IS
  RECOMMENDED THAT YOU RUN 'make distclean' AND THEN RERUN './configure'!
