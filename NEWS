   privilege flags. Read doc/reference.conf for further explanation of what
   these flags control

o) Removed the servlink program. ircd-hybrid can now make use of
   SSL/TLS for inter-server communication.
   NOTE: compressed server links are of course still available, but a SSL/TLS
   connection is required, as compression is now handled via OpenSSL
o) Removed 'ssl_server_protocol' configuration directive and
   added 'ssl_client_method' and 'ssl_server_method' instead.
   Both of these options can now be changed at runtime
