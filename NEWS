-- ircd-hybrid-8beta1 Release Notes
o) Implemented full services support, including but not limited to the
   following changes:
   - Added SVSNICK, and SVSMODE command handlers
   - Added service stamps to NICK/UID messages
   - Added SVS to server capabilities (CAPAB). SVS capable servers can
     deal with extended NICK/UID messages that contain service IDs/stamps.
   - Changed rejected client notices to go to new usermode +j.  These
     previously used usermode +r.
   - Added usermode +r (registered nick) and channelmode +r (registered channel)
   - Added usermode +R (only registered clients may send a private message)
   - Added channelmode +R (only registered clients may join that channel)
   - Various services shortcuts have been added (/NS, /CS, /NICKSERV, /CHANSERV, etc.)
   - Added services{} block to ircd.conf
   - Added services_name directive to general{} block
   - Added GLOBOPS mainly for services compatibility, but can be used by operators, too
o) Removed RKLINE and RXLINE commands. Regular expression based bans should
   only be added via ircd.conf
o) Added 'globops', 'restart', 'dline', 'undline' and 'module' operator
   privilege flags. Read doc/reference.conf for further explanation of what
   these flags control
o) Removed Idle-time klines
o) Cleaned up modules API. Old modules won't work anymore
o) Removed general::burst_away configuration directive. AWAY bursts are now
   controlled via connect::flags explicitly
o) Introduced new logging subsystem including log rotation based on
   file sizes. Log timestamp format is ISO8601 now
o) Added support for remote D-lines
o) Added usermode +H which is basically a replacement for the hidden_admin and
   hidden_oper operator flags. With usermode +H, irc operator status can now
   be hidden even on remote servers
o) Added CIDR support for operator{} blocks
o) Removed the servlink program. ircd-hybrid can now make use of
   SSL/TLS for inter-server communication.
   NOTE: compressed server links are of course still available, but a SSL/TLS
   connection is required, as compression is now handled via OpenSSL
o) Removed 'ssl_server_protocol' configuration directive and
   added 'ssl_client_method' and 'ssl_server_method' instead.
   Both of these options can now be changed at runtime
o) Oper login IDs are no longer limited to NICKLEN*2
o) Removed channel::burst_topicwho configuration option. Topicsetters are
   now sent by default
