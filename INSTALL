   | Reading INSTALL is now a must, as the old DPATH is now specified when  |
   | configure is run.                                                      |

   | - You now need to ./configure --prefix="/path/to/install/it" as a      |
   |   minimum. Try ./configure --help or read this file for more info on   |
   |   the possible options you can pass to configure.                      |

                                  HOW TO BUILD

   As of hybrid-4, the distribution uses GNU autoconf instead of the old
   Config script. You must run ./configure before you can (sanely) build
   ircd-hybrid.
   
   1.  Read the NEWS file to find out about the exciting new features in
       this version. Other good reads are BUGS, doc/example.conf, and
       README.

   2.  Run the configure script. It will create config.h and the
       Makefiles to match your system. The paths are now handled
       with the --prefix option to configure.
       /usr/local/ircd is the default if no prefix is specified.

       ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/ircd

       The script will determine whichever of the following is best for 
       your system, but you may (unsupported) force their usage with 
       undefined results:

          * --enable-kqueue - Use the superior kqueue(2) system call as
            opposed to the default poll(2). This is currently only available
            on FreeBSD 4.1 or higher.

          * --enable-devpoll - Enable the superior /dev/poll support on
            Solaris. Linux /dev/poll is broken and will not work with this
            option.

          * --enable-epoll - Enables epoll(4) Signal I/O system. This is
            currently only available on 2.5.44 Linux kernel versions or
            later.

          * --enable-poll - Use POSIX poll(2).

          * --enable-select - Use POSIX select(2).

          Incidentally, the order of listing above is the order of auto-
          detection in configure. So if you do have kqueue but wish to
          enable select(2) instead (bad idea), you must use --enable-select.

          * --enable-openssl - Enable the openssl dependent crypto functions.
            Required for the SSL Challenge controlled OPER feature, compressed
            and/or SSL/TLS server links, as well as SSL/TLS client connections.

            On systems where the configure script can automatically detect
            OpenSSL, this option is not necessary. If configure cannot find
            OpenSSL, you must specify a path with this option
            (--enable-openssl=/path/to/openssl)


       These are optional or have default values that may be overridden:
   
          * --enable-assert - Enable use of numerous debugging checks. This
            should not be used on any production servers for maximum speed
            so as to prevent cores from things that shouldn't normally happen.

          * --enable-debugging - Prepares Makefiles to compile the ircd sources
            with proper settings that are required for debugging purposes.
            This switch basically sets CFLAGS to "-g -O0".

          * --enable-halfops - Enable halfops (%, mode +h) usage. Halfops
            are similar to plain ops, but can't kick/deop plain ops. Halfops
            may or may not kick/deop other halfops depending on if (+p) is
            set. Halfops may not set (+/-p).


   3.  Run 'make'; this should build the ircd.

   4.  Run 'make install'; this will install the server, modules, and tools
       in the path with the prefix specified when configure was ran.

                                HOW TO GET HELP

   - Send Check or Money Order to... just kidding! You're on your own for
     support. Try asking other ircd-hybrid admins on EFnet if you can't 
     fix it yourself. If you do fix anything, however, please send context
     or unified diffs to bugs@ircd-hybrid.org so the fixes can be 
     incorporated into the next release of ircd-hybrid. If hybrid crashes
     on you, PLEASE contact bugs@ircd-hybrid.org ASAP with a backtrace of
     the core. The Hybrid team can't fix bugs if no one tells us about them!

   - https://lists.ircd-hybrid.org/mailman/listinfo/hybrid
     Here you can subscribe to a mailing list for general discussion of Hybrid.

                                     NOTES

   The best way to get a backtrace of the core is to follow this sequence of
   instructions:

   1.  Change to the directory containing the core file

   2.  Run gdb on the binary and the core file. With an unmodified ircd-hybrid
       installation, an example command line is below (in the /usr/local/ircd
       directory)

       $ gdb bin/ircd ircd.core


   3.  At the "(gdb)" prompt, enter the command "bt full"

   4.  Save the output of the backtrace command and send it to
       bugs@ircd-hybrid.org.

   5.  Be sure to save the ircd binary, the modules, and the core file in a
       safe place in case the developers need to look deeper than a backtrace
       provides.
