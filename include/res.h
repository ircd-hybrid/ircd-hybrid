/*
 * From RFC 1035:
 *
 * Domain names in messages are expressed in terms of a sequence of labels.
 * Each label is represented as a one octet length field followed by that
 * number of octets.  Since every domain name ends with the null label of
 * the root, a domain name is terminated by a length byte of zero.  The
 * high order two bits of every length octet must be zero, and the
 * remaining six bits of the length field limit the label to 63 octets or
 * less.
 *
 * To simplify implementations, the total length of a domain name (i.e.,
 * label octets and label length octets) is restricted to 255 octets or
 * less.
