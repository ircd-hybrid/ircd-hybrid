SVSNICK <oldnick> <newnick>

The SVSNICK command is designed to change a user's nickname to something else.
This is mainly to be used by services such as NickServ but can be used for
other purposes.

If you want to chance nick1 to nick2 for instance you issue the following:

SVSNICK nick1 nick2

You won't get a confirmation of the nickname change unless you are +n however.
