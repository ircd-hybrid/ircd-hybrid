o) Fixed compile warning with gcc 4.6
o) Minor fixes to m_cap module
o) Added CIDR support for operator{} blocks


-- ircd-hybrid-7.3.1 Release Notes

   nick!user@host mask output
o) Update RPL_ISUPPORT. CHANMODES now reflects new +OS channelmodes

   occur if a server sends redundant usermodes within a NICK message


-- ircd-hybrid-7.3.0 Release Notes
o) Added Bulgarian language file provided by Borislav Borisov

   can join this channel.


-- ircd-hybrid-7.3-rc1 Release Notes
o) Major 64-bit cleanups and portability fixes.
o) Fixed bug where unregistered clients were not able to complete registration
   process with /quote PONG <ping_cookie> in case the client was assigned a
   zero value ping-cookie. This may only happen with general::ping_cookie
   being enabled.
o) "STATS z" now shows the actual amount of memory consumption being
   used by channel bans/excepts/invites.
o) Fixed archaic bug where bursting servers with missconfigured NICKLEN were
   able to desync the network's nickname database.

   now automatically detect an already installed version of the PCRE library.
o) Various resolver improvements and fixes
o) Implemented GUNGLINE (global ungline)
o) Completely rewrote build system. We're now using automake and libtool
o) Added support for SHA-256/512 encrypted passwords to mkpasswd. Whether
   passwords hashed using these algorithms will work depends on the system's
   crypt() implementation. For example, SHA-256/512 is available in glibc since
   version 2.7.
o) Added ssl_server_protocol configuration option to servinfo{}.
   Valid flags are 'sslv3' and 'tlsv1'

o) Fixed topic desynchronization which sometimes may
   happen during netbursts
o) WATCH support implemented. Known from other irc-daemons, such
   as Dreamforge and Bahamut. The general::max_watch configuration directive
   has been added in order to allow run-time configuration of how many
   watch entries a single client may have on its watchlist.
o) Fixed bug which would cause invalid invisible counts on oper-up in case
   operator::umodes and/or general::oper_umodes contains 'invisible'
o) Removed broken LazyLinks
