/*! \file auth.c
 * \brief Implementation of DNS and ident lookups.
 */

/*
 * Changes:
 *   July 6, 1999 - Rewrote most of the code here. When a client connects
 *     to the server and passes initial socket validation checks, it
 *     is owned by this module (auth) which returns it to the rest of the
 *     server when dns and auth queries are finished. Until the client is
 *     released, the server does not know it exists and does not process
 *     any messages from it.
