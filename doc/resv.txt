				RESV
			      -======-

- What is resv, and why was it coded?

  Resv is a method of 'juping' or 'reserving' nicks and channels, to prevent
  local clients using them. It is commonly used to block channels which
  are home to abusers, and which attract DoS. It can also be used to stop
  people pretending to be services, on a network that doesn't support them.

  It was coded to replace the method in hybrid-6 of blocking channels and
  nicks, and was implemented in a much cleaner way to make it faster.

  The hybrid-6 method used to have to physically create channels, and
  suffered flaws, resv does not.

- How can I create a resv?

  There are two types of resv. 'permanent' and 'temporary'. Temporary
  resv's will be erased when a server restarts (they will stay through a
  rehash). Permanent resv's will stay through a restart.

  You may add permanent resv's into ircd.conf, but they are deprecated.
  They should have the reason for the resv, followed by the nicks and
  channels being resv'd. The following would block the channel
  #services, the nick 'services' and any nick ending in 'serv' (ie: chanserv)

  resv {
  	reason = "There are no services on this network";
	channel = "#services";
	nick = "services";
	nick = "*serv";
  };

  All resv's created by RESV are stored in cresv.conf or nresv.conf depending
  on the nature of the RESV.

    Syntax: /quote resv <#channel|nick> :<reason>

  So to resv #warez:
    /quote resv #warez :No warez on this network.

  To resv kiddie01:
    /quote resv kiddie01 :Abuse

  To resv clone*:
    /quote resv clone* :clones

    If a non admin does this, he will see:
      -irc.leeh.co.uk- You must be an admin to perform a wildcard RESV

- How do I remove a resv?

  If the resv is stored in ircd.conf, then the resv must be removed from there,
  then a /rehash, should do the trick.

  If the resv was made using /RESV, then use the unresv command:
    
    Syntax: /quote unresv <#channel|nick>

- Can I make a resv on all servers?

  No.  In Hybrid resv's are local only.  If a channel is full of abusers,
  the solution is not to just block the channel, the abusers themselves
  should be removed through /kline and /dline.

- How do I list resv's?

  To list all current resv's:
    /stats q

  Which will give a reply like:
    q #warez No warez *@*
    Q hax No hackers allowed here

  If the first letter is a 'q', then the resv is in [cn]resv.conf, if the
  first letter is a 'Q' then the resv is hardcoded (in ircd.conf).

- What does a client see if they try using a channel/nick that is resv'd?

  They see the numeric 437 (ERR_UNAVAILRESOURCE)

  Other networks (namely IRCNet) use this numeric on a split, to indicate
  the channel cannot be joined, as such it is recognised by a lot of
  clients.

- Can an oper see when someone tries to use a resv'd nick/channel?

  No.  When there is a valid reason for this, then possibly, but I honestly
  don't see why anyone needs it.

- Can I resv a local channel?

  Yes. It takes the same format as creating a resv on a normal channel:
    /resv &clones :no clonebots!
    
- Do you support wildcard channel resv's?

  No.  This is mainly for speed reasons.  When we are searching nicks, we
  cannot just check if the nick, and the item in the list of resv'd nicks
  are string equal, we have to check if they match, so we have to search a
  full list.  With channels however, we can search a hash table to see if an
  entry exists, if it doesn't, then the channel isn't resv'd.  We don't have
  to search through all the channels.

  Besides.. it's legal for a channel to be called #*warez* anyway ;)
