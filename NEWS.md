  variable. See https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/source-date-epoch/ for more
  information.
* Extban `$Q` of type acting has been implemented. This extban prevents
  matching users from using the `KICK` command.
* Implemented channel mode `Q`. `KICK` cannot be used on channels with that mode set.
* Implemented user mode `Z`. Users with that mode set may only receive private
  messages from other users that are connected via TLS.
* Fixed issue where `WHO nick` on invisible clients (user mode `i`) wouldn't work


#### Noteworthy changes in version 8.2.41 (2022-07-15)
* Fixed issue where `WHO` didn't work on channel names with two or more consequent
  asterisk characters
* IRCv3 WHOX has been implemented. See `doc/who.txt` for more information about
  the new `WHO` options and features.

  who reply


#### Noteworthy changes in version 8.2.40 (2022-07-02)
* `channel::disable_fake_channels` now also blocks strikethrough text (0x1E (30))
* `KNOCK` can now be used on private channels. Channel mode `K` may be used instead
  to control whether or not `KNOCK` is allowed on a channel.
* Support for `/dev/poll` has been dropped
* `INFO` now also reports configured values of `channel::default_join_flood_count`
  and `channel::default_join_flood_time`
* The founder `q` and admin `a` channel prefix modes have been implemented.
  These are optional and can be enabled with the new `channel::enable_owner`
  and `channel::enable_admin` configuration directives.

#### Noteworthy changes in version 8.2.39 (2021-08-14)
* `hidechans` and `hideidle` may now be set in `general::oper_only_umodes`
* OpenSSL 3.0 compatibility improvements
* Fixed crashing issue in the mkpasswd tool with older glibc
* Fixed issue where the ircd wouldn't listen on both IPv4 and IPv6 ports in
  case only a port but no address has been specified in a listen {} block

* Minimum supported version of the Anope IRC services is now 2.0.8
* Fixed displaying issue with channel `MODE` messages
* Characters valid for user names (ident) for local clients are now `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`.
  Special characters like ``}|{`^]\[$``, that were allowed previously, are no longer
  valid. Also user names may not begin with `.`, `_`, or `-`.
* The `general::dots_in_ident` configuration directive has been renamed to
  `general::specials_in_ident` and now covers the `-` and `_` characters in
  addition to `.`
* Fixed issue with clients connected from IPv6 localhost that, depending on the
  system's `getaddrinfo` implementation, could lead to a crash of remote servers


#### Noteworthy changes in version 8.2.37 (2020-12-26)
* Implemented IRCv3 `CAP 302`
* Implemented IRCv3 `cap-notify` capability
* In case a client sends multiple `PASS` messages, ircd only accepts the password
  sent in the first `PASS` message instead of the last one
* Missing help file for `MONITOR` has been added
* Fixed slightly off memory count for motds in `STATS z`


#### Noteworthy changes in version 8.2.36 (2020-12-04)
* The old `WATCH` implementation has been replaced with IRCv3.2 `MONITOR`. For this,
  the `general::max_watch` configuration directive has been renamed to
  `general::max_monitor`.
* User mode `B` has been implemented. Clients with that mode set are marked as a
  bot in both `WHOIS` and `WHO`. This mode can only be set by IRC operators (as
  long as the `bot` directive is set in `general::oper_only_umodes`), servers,
  and services.
  This mode can for example be used to mark HOPM as official network bot.


#### Noteworthy changes in version 8.2.35 (2020-11-14)
* Fixed issue where servers could propagate truncated ban masks during net-join


#### Noteworthy changes in version 8.2.34 (2020-11-01)
* Re-implement backwards compatibility mode for old ircd-hybrid 8.2.23 and below.
  Final removal is scheduled for early 2021.
* For consistency, the `general::network_desc` configuration directive has been
  renamed to `general::network_description`
* Server notices that previously have been sent to user modes `f` and `u` are now
  sent to user mode `j` (reject notices) instead. Due to this change, `unauth` and
  `full` have been removed from `general::oper_only_umodes`, `general::oper_umodes`,
  and `operator::umodes`.
* User mode `b` (bots) has been replaced with `f` (flood). Spam/flood notices are now
  sent to this user mode. For this, `bots` has been removed from
  `general::oper_only_umodes`, `general::oper_umodes`, and `operator::umodes`.
  `flood` has been added instead to these configuration directives.
* Stricten server/user ID validation. IDs have to be all uppercase everywhere now.

* `RESV` couldn't be issued in case no reason has been supplied. This has been fixed.
* Fixed possible `RPL_WHOISCHANNELS` line truncation of remote replies
* Extban `$t` of type matching has been implemented. This extban allows matching
  based on TLS protocol version and/or cipher suite.
* Implemented channel mode `K`. `KNOCK` cannot be used on channels with that mode set.
* `STATS ?` is now oper-only


#### Noteworthy changes in version 8.2.31 (2020-05-03)
* macOS compatibility fixes
* Removed `spoof_notice` from `auth::flags`. With vhosts now this notice doesn't make
  much sense anymore.
* Fixed issue where ban masks might become malformed if set by remote clients/servers
* Fixed issue with channel mode `c` where high ascii characters can be erroneously
  detected as control characters


#### Noteworthy changes in version 8.2.30 (2020-03-01)
* `QUOTE HELP extban` didn't work because the extban help file hasn't been
  installed properly during `make install`
* Fixed broken libcrypto detection which caused the ircd not to work with
  OpenSSL under certain circumstances
* Extban `$n` of type acting has been implemented. This extban prevents
  matching users from changing their nick while in the channel. Users
  with voice or above are not affected.
* Channel mode `N` has been changed so channel members with `v` (voice) can
  change their nick name as well


#### Noteworthy changes in version 8.2.29 (2020-02-19)
* Extbans have been implemented. Currently supported extbans:

  Matching:

  * `$a:<account>`   Matches users logged into a matching account.
  * `$c:<channel>`   Matches users that are on the given channel. An additional
                     prefix of either `@`, `%`, or `+` can be specified to test
                     for certain channel privileges.
  * `$o:<class>`     Matches IRC operators that have joined a class
                     matching the mask.
  * `$r:<realname>`  Matches users with a matching realname.
  * `$s:<server>`    Matches users that are connected to a server matching the mask.
  * `$u:<modes>`     Matches users having the specified user modes set or not set.
  * `$z:<certfp>`    Matches users having the given TLS certificate fingerprint.

  Acting:

  * `$j:<banmask>`   Prevents matching users from joining the channel.
  * `$m:<banmask>`   Blocks messages from matching users. Users with voice
                     or above are not affected.

  For more details, see `help/extban`.
* Added `channel::enable_extbans` configuration option. See `doc/reference.conf`
  for more information.

  from bypassing channel bans by activating a fakehost


#### Noteworthy changes in version 8.2.27 (2020-01-22)
* Experimental support for wolfSSL has been implemented. Minimum supported version is 4.3.0
* The `--enable-openssl`, `--enable-gnutls` switches, and their disabling counterparts
  `--disable-openssl` and `--disable-gnutls`, have been replaced with the `--with-tls`
  switch which takes one of the following options: `openssl`, `wolfssl`, `gnutls`,
  and `none`.
  If nothing has been specified, configure tries to autodetect in the following order:
  OpenSSL/LibreSSL -> GnuTLS -> wolfSSL.
* Fixed segfault with GnuTLS/libgmp in case there's no DH parameters file
  defined in `serverinfo::ssl_dh_param_file` or if that file is missing
* The connection timeout for connect {} blocks can now be configured via
  the `connect::timeout` configuration directive
* Minimum supported OpenSSL version is 1.1.1 now
* Minimum supported GnuTLS version is 3.6.5 now
* Supported TLSv1.3 cipher suites can now be configured explicitely via the
  new `serverinfo::tls_cipher_suites` configuration directive
* In the serverinfo {} block, the following configuration directives have been renamed:
    `ssl_certificate_file` -> `tls_certificate_file`
    `ssl_dh_param_file` -> `tls_dh_param_file`
    `ssl_dh_elliptic_curve` -> `tls_supported_groups`
    `ssl_cipher_list` -> `tls_cipher_list`
    `ssl_message_digest_algorithm` -> `tls_message_digest_algorithm`

#### Noteworthy changes in version 8.2.26 (2019-05-31)
* The `general::tkline_expire_notices` configuration directive has been
  replaced with user mode `X`. *LINE expiration notices are sent to IRC
  operators with that mode set

  instead of updating existing ones that are already in use


#### Noteworthy changes in version 8.2.25 (2019-04-24)
* The `class::number_per_ip`, `class::max_local` and `class::max_global`
  configuration directives have been replaced with just `class::number_per_ip_local`
  and `class::number_per_ip_global`. The `class::max_local` basically was
  redundant as it had the same functionality as `class::number_per_ip`
* Adding RESVs with wildcards no longer requires administrator privileges

  when deoppering
* Fixed `unknown closes` statistic in `STATS t` showing invalid values sometimes


#### Noteworthy changes in version 8.2.22 (2017-03-26)
* Implemented channel mode `L`. Channels with that mode set can make use of an
  extended ban list size specified with the new `channel::max_bans_large`
  configuraton option. This mode can be set only by IRC operators or servers.
* Implemented channel mode `u` which hides bmask (+b/+e/+I) lists and mode changes
  to non-chanops everywhere

  for more information.
* `INVITE` expirations have been implemented. Expire time can be adjusted with
  the `channel::invite_expire_time` configuration directive.

  required to see them
* The maximum line length for motd files has been increased to 320 bytes to
  support multibyte encodings better

* Further improvements to GnuTLS support


#### Noteworthy changes in version 8.2.13 (2016-02-02)
* Implemented support for GnuTLS. Currently ./configure's autodetection
  intentionally prefers OpenSSL over GnuTLS, so OpenSSL detection needs

  with cluster {} and/or shared {} blocks is now the recommended
  way to add global user@host mask based server bans
* Added `dline_min_cidr`, `dline_min_cidr6`, `kline_min_cidr`, and
 `kline_min_cidr6` configuration options to the general {} block
* Fixed bug where a `REHASH` would clear all X-Lines and RESVs that have
  been set with the `XLINE`/`RESV commands`

  following changes:
  - Added `SVSNICK`, and `SVSMODE` command handlers
  - Added service stamps to `NICK`/`UID` messages
  - Added SVS to server capabilities (`CAPAB`). SVS capable servers can
    deal with extended `NICK`/`UID` messages that contain service IDs/stamps.
  - Changed rejected client notices to go to new user mode `j`. These
    previously used user mode `r`.
  - Added user mode `r` (registered nick) and channel mode `r` (registered channel)

  only be added via `ircd.conf`.
* Added `globops`, `restart`, `dline`, `undline` and `module` IRC operator privilege flags.
  Read `doc/reference.conf` for further explanation of what these flags control.

* Removed `general::burst_away` configuration directive. `AWAY` bursts are now
  controlled via `connect::flags` explicitly.
* Introduced new logging subsystem including log rotation based on
  file sizes. Log timestamp format is ISO8601 now.
* Added support for remote D-lines

  `hidden_oper` operator flags. With user mode `H`, IRC operator status can now
  be hidden even on remote servers

* Removed the servlink program. ircd-hybrid can now make use of
  SSL/TLS for inter-server communication.
  NOTE: compressed server links are of course still available, but a SSL/TLS
  connection is required, as compression is now handled via OpenSSL
* Removed `ssl_server_protocol` configuration directive and
  added `ssl_client_method` and `ssl_server_method` instead.
  Both of these options can now be changed at runtime.

* Removed `channel::burst_topicwho` configuration option. This feature is now
  enabled by default.
* `STATS Y|y` now reports CIDR limits as well
