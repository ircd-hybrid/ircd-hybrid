CONNECT <server_A> [port] [server_B]

When [server_B] is used, CONNECT asks [server_B] to
connect to <server_A>.  Requires Oper Priv: R

The [port] must be specified with [server_B], this is
usually 6667.  To use the default port in the connect
block, you can use 0 as the port.

When [server_B] is not used, CONNECT tries to connect
your server to <server_A>.

When [port] is used, the connection will be attempted
to [port].
When [port] is not used, 6667 is used as a default,
unless the port is specified in the conf file.
