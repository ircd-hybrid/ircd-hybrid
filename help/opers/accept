ACCEPT [parameter]

ACCEPT allows you to control who can send you a NOTICE or PRIVMSG
while you have user mode +g enabled.

For +g: /QUOTE ACCEPT <n!u@h>   -- Add a permitted mask
        /QUOTE ACCEPT -<n!u@h>  -- Remove a permitted mask
        /QUOTE ACCEPT *         -- List the present permitted masks
        /QUOTE ACCEPT           -- List the present permitted masks
