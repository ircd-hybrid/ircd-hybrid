NAMES [channel]

With no channel argument, NAMES shows the names (nicks) of all clients
logged in to the server that do not have +i flag.

With the #channel argument, it displays the nicks on that channel,
also respecting the +i flag of each client. If the channel specified
is a channel that the issuing client is currently in, all nicks are
listed in similar fashion to when the user first joins a channel.
