-- ircd-hybrid-8beta2 Release Notes
o) channel::disable_fake_channels now also disables ascii 29 (mIRC italic)
   when set to yes
o) Added channel::max_chans_per_oper configuration directive. The old way
   was to let ircops join three times the amount of max_chans_per_user
o) Replaced MODLOAD, MODUNLOAD, MODRELOAD, MODLIST and MODRESTART commands
   with the new MODULE command which can be fed with the LOAD, UNLOAD, RELOAD
   and LIST parameters.
   MODRESTART has been entirely removed. Use "MODULE RELOAD *" to reload all modules
o) Added back server notice when a client tries to obtain a reserved nick name
o) Removed OMOTD module
o) Added 'set' to operator privilege flags. Gives access to the "SET" command
o) Improved TS6 support


-- ircd-hybrid-8beta1 Release Notes
o) Implemented full services support. Among other things, the following changes
   have been done for this:
   - Added SVSNICK, and SVSMODE command handlers
   - Added service stamps to NICK/UID messages
   - Added SVS to server capabilities (CAPAB). SVS capable servers can
     deal with extended NICK/UID messages that contain service IDs/stamps.
   - Usermode +r (registered nick) has been added, as well as
     channelmode +r (registered channel)
   - Now that usermode +r has a different function than before, rejected
     client notices now go to new usermode +j
   - Various services shortcuts have been added (/NS, /CS, /NICKSERV, /CHANSERV, etc.)
   - Added channelmode +R (only registered clients may join that channel)
   - Added usermode +R (only registered clients may send a private message)
   - Added services{} block to ircd.conf
   - Added services_name directive to general{} block
   - Added GLOBOPS mainly for services compatibility, but can be used by operators, too
o) RKLINE and RXLINE commands have been removed. Regular expression based
   bans should only be added via ircd.conf
o) Added 'globops', 'restart', 'dline', 'undline' and 'module' operator privilege flags.
   Read doc/example.conf for further explanation of what these flags
   are supposed to be doing
o) Idle-time klines have been removed
o) Cleaned up modules API. Old modules won't work anymore
o) Remove general::burst_away configuration directive. AWAY bursts are now
   controlled via connect::flags explicitly
o) Introduced new logging subsystem including log rotation based on
   file sizes. Log timestamp format is ISO8601 now
o) Added support for remote D-lines
o) Added usermode +H which is basically a replacement for the hidden_admin and
   hidden_oper operator flags. With usermode +H, irc operator status can now
   be hidden even on remote servers
o) Added CIDR support for operator{} blocks
o) The servlink program has been removed. ircd-hybrid can now make use of SSL/TLS
   for inter-server communication.
   NOTE: compressed server links are of course still available, but a SSL/TLS
   connection is required, as compression is now handled via the OpenSSL library
o) Removed 'ssl_server_protocol' configuration directive and
   added 'ssl_client_method' and 'ssl_server_method' instead.
   Both of these options can now be changed at runtime
o) Oper login IDs are no longer limited to NICKLEN*2
o) Removed channel::burst_topicwho configuration option. Topicsetters are
   now sent by default
o) "STATS Y|y" now reports CIDR limits as well
o) Added m_webirc.c to contrib/
o) Overall code cleanup and speed improvements
