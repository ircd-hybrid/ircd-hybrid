JOIN <#channel1[,#channel2,#channel3...]> [key]

The JOIN command allows you to enter a public chat area known as
a channel. You can join more than one channel at a time,
separating their names with comma's (',').

If the channel has a key set, the second argument must be
given to enter. This allows channels to be password protected.
