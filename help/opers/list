LIST [options]

Without any arguments, LIST will give an entire list of all
channels which are not set as secret (+s). The list will be in
the form:

  <#channel> <amount of users> :[topic]

If you want to use a specific filter, you can pass one or more
options separated by commas (','). Recognized options are:
  *mask*   List channels matching *mask*
  !*mask*  List channels NOT matching *mask*
  >num     Show only channels which contain more than <num> users
  <num     Show only channels which contain less than <num> users
  C>num    Display channels created within last <num> minutes
  C<num    Display channels created earlier than <num> minutes ago
  T>num    Limit matches to those channels whose topics are older
           than <num> minutes
  T<num    Limit matches to those channels whose topics have been
           changed within last <num> minutes

To stop a running LIST request, use /LIST command again.
