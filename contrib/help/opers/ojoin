OJOIN [flags]<channel>

The OJOIN command requires only one argument with optional status flags.
Valid mode flags are @ % and +. This allows operators to join any channel
with the given status.

Examples:
OJOIN @#secretchan - Will join you to #secretchan with chan ops.
OJOIN +#secretchan - Will join you to #secretchan with voice.

This also works on local channels as well.
