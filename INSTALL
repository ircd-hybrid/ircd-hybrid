   | Reading INSTALL is now a must, as the old DPATH is now specified when  |
   | configure is run.                                                      |

   | - You now need to ./configure --prefix="/path/to/install/it" as a      |
   |   minimum. Try ./configure --help or read this file for more info on   |
   |   the possible options you can pass to configure.                      |

                                  HOW TO BUILD

   As of hybrid-4, the distribution uses GNU autoconf instead of the old
   Config script. You must run ./configure before you can (sanely) build
   ircd-hybrid.

   1.  Read the NEWS file to find out about the exciting new features in
       this version. Other good reads are doc/reference.conf, and README.

   2.  Run the configure script. It will create config.h and the
       Makefiles to match your system. The paths are now handled
       with the --prefix option to configure.
       /usr/local/ircd is the default if no prefix is specified.

       ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/ircd

       The script will determine whichever of the following is best for
       your system, but you may (unsupported) force their usage with
       undefined results:

          * --enable-kqueue - Use the superior kqueue(2) system call as
            opposed to the default poll(2). This is currently only available
            on FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly BSD and macOS

          * --enable-devpoll - Enable the superior /dev/poll support on
            Solaris. Linux /dev/poll is broken and will not work with this
            option.

          * --enable-epoll - Enables epoll(4) Signal I/O system. This is
            currently only available on 2.5.44 Linux kernel versions or
            later.

          * --enable-poll - Use POSIX poll(2).

          Incidentally, the order of listing above is the order of auto-
          detection in configure. So if you do have kqueue but wish to
          enable poll(2) instead (bad idea), you must use --enable-poll.

          * --with-tls= - Controls TLS (Transport Layer Security) support. 
            Supported options are currently 'openssl, 'wolfssl', 'gnutls',
            and 'none'.

            If nothing has been specified, configure tries to autodetect in the
            following order: openssl/libressl -> gnutls -> wolfssl.


       These are optional or have default values that may be overridden:

          * --enable-assert - Enable use of numerous debugging checks. This is
            considered a developer-only feature and should not be used on any
            production servers for maximum speed so as to prevent cores from
            things that shouldn't normally happen.

          * --enable-debugging - Prepares Makefiles to compile the ircd sources
            with proper settings that are required for debugging purposes.
            This switch basically sets CFLAGS to "-g -O0".

          * --enable-efence - Allows easy linking with the electric fence memory
            debugger library.


   3.  Run 'make'; this should build the ircd.

   4.  Run 'make install'; this will install the server, modules, and tools
       in the path with the prefix specified when configure was ran.

                                HOW TO GET HELP

   - Send Check or Money Order to... just kidding! For bugs, patches or crash
     reports, contact bugs@ircd-hybrid.org. Please provide as much information
     as possible, context or unified diffs or backtrace of the core.
     The Hybrid team can't fix bugs if no one tells us about them!

   - For general discussion or support, you can subscribe to our mailing list at
     https://lists.ircd-hybrid.org/mailman/listinfo/hybrid. Alternatively,
     you can find us on IRC in #ircd-coders on irc.ircd-hybrid.org.

                                     NOTES

   The best way to get a backtrace of the core is to follow this sequence of
   instructions:

   1.  Change to the directory containing the core file

   2.  Run gdb on the binary and the core file. With an unmodified ircd-hybrid
       installation, an example command line is below (in the /usr/local/ircd
       directory)

       $ gdb bin/ircd ircd.core


   3.  At the "(gdb)" prompt, enter the command "bt full"

   4.  Save the output of the backtrace command and send it to
       bugs@ircd-hybrid.org.

   5.  Be sure to save the ircd binary, the modules, and the core file in a
       safe place in case the developers need to look deeper than a backtrace
       provides.
