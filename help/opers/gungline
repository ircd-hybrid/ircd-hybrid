GUNGLINE <user@host> :[reason]

-- if glines are enabled --
Attempts to remove a global IRC-network wide ban on
<user@host> for the reason [reason].

It takes three different opers on three different
servers to do the same GUNGLINE within a short interval,
to have a GUNGLINE triggered for a compiled time of hours.

GUNGLINE user@ip.ip.ip.ip
will ungline the user at the unresolved ip.
ip.ip.ip.ip can be in CIDR form i.e. 192.168.0.0/24
or 192.168.0.* (which is converted to CIDR form internally)

- Requires Oper Priv: G
