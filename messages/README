The ircd-hybrid team is not accountable for any mistakes, mistranslations, or
accidental insults from the use of one of the included translations.  All
translations are done by individuals who have given their time and skills to
provide localized users with pre-built translations.  The ircd-hybrid team
will try, but cannot guarantee that the translations are up to date with the
rest of the source tree, and with the "customized" messages.

Contributions are welcome, at present time please send contributed translations
to bugs@ircd-hybrid.org, hybrid@ircd-hybrid.org, or directly to one of the people
who work with the translations.
