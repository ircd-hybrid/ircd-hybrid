******************************* IMPORTANT *************************************


  ************ Note for those who don't bother reading docs ***************
  * - Reading INSTALL is now a must, as the old DPATH is now specified    *
  *   when configure is run.                                              *
  *   You now need to ./configure --prefix="/path/to/install/it"          *
  * - The old config format WILL NOT WORK. Please see doc/example.conf !  *
  * - The old kline, dline, xline format WILL NOT WORK.                   *
  *************************************************************************

  ALSO, IF YOU ARE UPGRADING YOUR CURRENT SOURCE TREE, AND YOU TRY TO BUILD
  IN IT WITHOUT PERFORMING AT LEAST 'make clean', THINGS _WILL_ BREAK. IT IS
  RECOMMENDED THAT YOU RUN 'make distclean' AND THEN RERUN './configure'!

******************************* REQUIREMENTS **********************************

Necessary Requirements:

- A supported platform (look below)

- A working dynamic load library

Feature Specific Requirements:

- For the SSL Challenge controlled OPER feature, compressed and/or
  SSL/TLS server links, as well as SSL/TLS client connections,
  a working OpenSSL library is required

- For encrypted oper and (optional) server passwords, a working DES and/or
  MD5 library

- For regular expression based kline{} and gecos{} blocks, the

*******************************************************************************

- See the INSTALL document for info on configuring and compiling
  ircd-hybrid.

- Please read doc/index.txt to get an overview of the current documentation.

- TESTED PLATFORMS:  The code has been tested on the following platforms, and
  is known to run properly.
  (FIXME: this list is out of date)
  CentOS 5.8
  Red Hat Linux 9
  Ubuntu 12.04
  OpenBSD 5.2
  Arch Linux 2012.12.01
  Debian GNU/Hurd 0.3

- If you are wondering why config.h no longer exists, it's because most
  things that were once in config.h are now specified in the 'general'
  block of ircd.conf. Look at example.conf for more information about
  these options.

- /etc/resolv.conf must exist for the resolver to work.

- Please read NEWS for information about what is in this release.

- Other files recommended for reading: INSTALL
