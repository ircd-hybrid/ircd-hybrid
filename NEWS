o) Implemented full services support, including but not limited to the
   following changes:
   - Added SVSNICK, and SVSMODE command handlers
   - Added service stamps to NICK/UID messages
   - Added SVS to server capabilities (CAPAB). SVS capable servers can
     deal with extended NICK/UID messages that contain service IDs/stamps.
   - Changed rejected client notices to go to new usermode +j.  These
     previously used usermode +r.
   - Added usermode +r (registered nick) and channelmode +r (registered channel)
   - Added usermode +R (only registered clients may send a private message)

   privilege flags. Read doc/reference.conf for further explanation of what
   these flags control
o) Removed Idle-time klines

o) Removed general::burst_away configuration directive. AWAY bursts are now
   controlled via connect::flags explicitly
o) Introduced new logging subsystem including log rotation based on
   file sizes. Log timestamp format is ISO8601 now

o) Added usermode +H which is basically a replacement for the hidden_admin and
   hidden_oper operator flags. With usermode +H, irc operator status can now
   be hidden even on remote servers
o) Added CIDR support for operator{} blocks
o) Removed the servlink program. ircd-hybrid can now make use of
   SSL/TLS for inter-server communication.
   NOTE: compressed server links are of course still available, but a SSL/TLS
   connection is required, as compression is now handled via OpenSSL
o) Removed 'ssl_server_protocol' configuration directive and
   added 'ssl_client_method' and 'ssl_server_method' instead.
   Both of these options can now be changed at runtime
o) Oper login IDs are no longer limited to NICKLEN*2
