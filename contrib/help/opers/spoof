SPOOF <user@hostname> <free.form.spoof|-> [flags|- [password]]

The SPOOF command allows you to create free form auth {} spoofs for
various users on the fly and can propegate to other servers. It can
also append existant spoofs as well. To use the SPOOF command here
is an example if I want to spoof god@10.0.0.10:

You also need to make sure to have .include "spoof.conf" in your ircd.conf

SPOOF *god@10.0.0.* i.hate.packets

That will give him the spoof. However you can specify flags as well:

t (no_tilde), i (need_ident), k (kline_exempt), g (gline_exempt),
l (exceed_limit), o (class = "opers"), f (can_flood), p (need_password)

So if I want to give god a spoof but exempt him from K-Lines and G-Lines:

SPOOF *god@10.0.0.* i.hate.packets kg

Will give god K-Line and G-Line exemptions.
