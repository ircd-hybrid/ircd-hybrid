ircd-hybrid contributive add-ons ::

This directory contains contributive modules, patches and other add-ons 
that have been created by other people, or are not suitable to be included
into the main ircd-hybrid tree for various reasons. The coding team does
not officially support modules, patches and add-ons nor do they guarantee
that any of them will work to their intended capacity.

It is to be noted WITH feeling, that not all of these modules, patches
or add-ons have been thoroughly tested, only that they've been tested
enough to see if they compile or work. This is one of the main driving
reasons why many of these are not in the main ircd-hybrid tree. At least
one or two of the modules in contrib have been known to core servers when
used. Heed this warning!

To reiterate, ONE OR MORE OF THESE MAY AND PROBABLY WILL CORE YOUR SERVER.
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. Reading this dicticates that you agree to the stated
fact.

Modules ::
-----------------------------------------------
ip_cloaking.c    --  This module enables IP/hostname cloaking support for
                     ircd-hybrid. It adds a CRC32 encrypted based cloaking
                     known to be used by other daemons such as Unreal IRCd
                     but with some modifications and different hashing
                     methods. Please read README.cloaking before you compile
                     and load this module, it contains VERY important
                     information.


m_capture.c      --  This module will essentially capture a client (making it
                     impossible for a user to send commands to the server).

                     Syntax: CAPTURE <nickname/mask>
		             UNCAPTURE <nickname/mask>

                     Example: (UN)CAPTURE scriptkiddie
		              (UN)CAPTURE *!*@abuser.host


m_change.c       --  This module will allow IRC operators to alter the ident,
                     hostname or gecos (realname) fields of a given user.

                     Syntax: CHGIDENT <nickname> <newident>
                             CHGHOST <nickname> <newhostname>
                             CHGNAME <nickname> <newname>

                     Example: CHGIDENT lart llama
                              CHGHOST lart i.hate.packets
                              CHGNAME lart oorgle


m_classlist.c    --  This module will show the number of clients connected in
                     a specific class. Valid classes would be servers, users,
                     operators, or any custom one you defined in class {} 
                     blocks.

                     Syntax: CLASSLIST <class>

                     Example: CLASSLIST users


m_clearchan.c    --  Similar to the OperServ command CLEARCHAN, this module
                     will clear all users out of a channel, joins the person
                     who issued it, and locks the channel. It should be noted
                     that this command can be abused heavily.

                     Example: CLEARCHAN #warez


m_ctrace.c       --  This module will perform a trace on a certain class. Valid
                     classes would be servers, users, operators or any custom
                     one you defined in class {} blocks.

                     Syntax: CTRACE <class>

m_flags.c        --  This module adds csircd like support for changing
                     usermodes. If passed without any arguments, it will
                     show what flags are enabled and which are available.

                     Syntax: FLAGS [+|-FLAG]

                     Example: FLAGS +CALLERID

                             FORCEPART <nickname> <channel>

                     Example: FORCEJOIN nick @#chitchat
                              FORCEPART lamer #chitchat


m_jupe.c         --  Similar to the OperServ command JUPE, this module adds the
                     ability to jupiter (ban) a server from your network. It can
                     be extremely dangerous if not used correctly or without 
                     proper information. So use it with EXTREME care.

                     Syntax: JUPE <server> :[reason]

                     Example: JUPE node.server.net :get lost


m_killhost.c     --  Similar to the OperServ command KILLHOST, allows you to
                     issue (mass) KILLs to a specific hostname or hostmask that is 
                     connected to the server.

                     Syntax: KILLHOST <hostmask> [reason]

                     Example: KILLHOST *@cloners.com clones


m_ltrace.c       --  This module will give a limited trace. This is similar to

                     status (@%+) It should be noted that this command can be
                     abused heavily.

                     Syntax: OJOIN [status]<channel>

                     Example: OJOIN @#private


m_operspy.c      --  This module will allow operators with access to spy on
                     users. It should be noted the notion of this module
                     practically invalidates any form of privacy.

                     Syntax: OPERSPY <LIST/WHO/MODE/WHOIS/NAMES> <parameter>


m_opme.c         --  This module will allow an IRC operator to op themselves in
                     an opless channel should the need arise.

                     Syntax: OPME <channel>
                     Example: OPME #orphanchan


m_services.c     --  This module will add services hook support to hybrid. It
                     will add secure messaging aliases to services like such
                     as NickServ, OperServ and so on. It also adds SVSNICK
                     support to allow NickServ to change nicknames should
                     a user fail to identify or if an operator chooses
                     to want to change a user's nickname if it is offensive.
                     To use the aliases simply do ServiceName without MSG,
                     e.g. /NickServ IDENTIFY instead of /MSG NickServ IDENTIFY.

                     Syntax: SVSNICK <nickname> <newnick>

                     Example: SVSNICK fsck lamer


m_spoof.c        --  This module adds automated auth {} block configurations
                     on local and over-local levels. Check m_spoof.c for
                     more information and the help pages for SPOOF and
                     DELSPOOF.

                     Syntax: SPOOF <umask@hmask> <spoof> [flags [password]]
                             DELSPOOF <umask@hmask>

                     Example: SPOOF *@some.host.org i.hate.packets lkgf
                              DELSPOOF *@other.host.edu


m_webirc.c       --  Adds CGI:IRC/WebIRC support. A special auth{} block is
                     required in order to enable WebIRC support. For more
                     details check m_webirc.c

                     their own modules.
