FLAGS [-|+ flag]

The FLAGS command is designed to enable or disable user mode flags in plain english.
The idea is to make it easier to toggle flags without having to remember their letter.

If you run FLAGS without any extra parameters or arguments you'll get an example listing:

--- Current flags: OWALLOPS SWALLOPS OKILLS SKILLS SNOTICES THROTTLES LWALLOPS CONNECTS SQUITS 
                   FULL INVISIBLE BOTS CALLERID
--- Current missing flags: STATSNOTICES CLICONNECTS CLIDISCONNECTS IPMISMATCHES UNAUTH DEBUG NICKCHANGES

So if you want to enable NICKCHANGES (+n) for instance you do

FLAGS +NICKCHANGES and you can disable it with FLAGS -NICKCHANGES
