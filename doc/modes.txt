                        User and Channel Modes Guide
			----------------------------

In /VERSION one might see something like this:

irc.corefailure.com hybrid-7beta5 oiwszcerkfydnxbaugl biklmnopstveIh bkloveIh

These describe the user modes, channel modes, and channel modes that require
arguments that are available to the user. It is hardcoded into src/messages.tab.

Here is a guide to the preceding modes:

User Modes:

+a - admin        - Admin status.  Able to load and unload modules,
                    and see IP's in STATS c
+b - bots         - See bot and drone flooding notices
+c - cconn        - Client connection/quit notices
+D - deaf         - Don't receive channel messages
+d - debug        - See debugging notices

Channel Modes:

+b - ban          - Channel ban on nick!user@host
+e - exempt       - Exemption from bans
+I - invex        - Invite exceptions, nick!user@host does not need to be
                    explicitly INVITE'd into the channel before being able
                    JOIN
+i - invite       - Invite only
+k - key          - Key/password for the channel
+l - limit        - Limit the number of users in a channel
+m - moderated    - Users without +v/h/o cannot send text to the channel
+n - noexternal   - Users must be in the channel to send text to it
+o - chanop       - Full operator status
+p - private      - Private is obsolete, this now restricts KNOCK, and can be
                    set at the same time as +s.
+s - secret       - The channel does not show up on NAMES or LIST or in the 
                    WHOIS channel list unless you are a member of the channel
+t - topic        - Only chanops can change the topic
+v - voice        - Can speak in a moderated channel, and is exempt from flood 
                    restrictions

The third part of the 004 numeric lists channel modes that require arguments.
Currently these are bkloveIh.

Note that most of the channel modes can be disabled in the conf file for
networks that do not wish to support them.
